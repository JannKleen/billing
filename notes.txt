Urgent
======
- Email is sent every time a user is saved in admin. Email should be sent upon user creation only. Fix this.
- Now, a group admin can deactivate users in other groups. Ensure that this never happens. There was a fix for group admin's ability to search and find users in other groups. Check whether this fixes the deactivation bug.
